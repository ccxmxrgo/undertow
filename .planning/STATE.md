# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-07)

**Core value:** Hitting notes must feel tight and fair on each player's own machine, while torpedoes reach rivals over the network fast enough that a friend's perfect streak is felt inside the same song.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Timing Core & Calibration

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Timing Core & Calibration)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-10-07 -- Phase 1 planning complete

Progress: [..........] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Local hit judgment, networked events only (ping never affects timing)
- Gameplay goes through an EventChannel seam (Loopback, Bot, Net) so versus is built offline first
- Transport for v1: ENet over Tailscale/ZeroTier; GodotSteam is an optional later swap
- Godot 4.7.2 standard build, GDScript, version pinned for all friends

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Godot is not installed on the dev PATH; Phase 1 setup must install it
- Windows audio output latency and Bluetooth devices (Phase 1 spike)
- Timing window values are tunable in JudgeConfig (about 50 ms constraint)
- 5-to-4 lane mapping rule must be fixed in Phase 2, before payload generation
- Steam peer support on Godot 4.7 is unverified (not blocking)
